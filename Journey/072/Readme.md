# The Other 50% (LFCS speedrun)

## Introduction

Today I completed labs and compiled questions from the remaining 50% of content I have not yet speedrun. I intend to have the full list of questions/ list of tasks compiled by thursday next week.

## Prerequisite
A CentOS 7 VM. 

## Speedrun Topics Remaining

- pam configuration
- systemd-networkd configuration
- systemd timers
- rsyslog
- working with kernel modules
- managing the boot procedure
- firewalling
- selinux (not really looking forward to this one lol)
- encrypted partition practice
- lvm
- RAID solutions
- managing user quotas on different file system types
- web service configuration (including virtual hosts)
- ftp services
- samba servers
- DNS
- web proxy
- email handling
- virtual machines KVM (not containers!)


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Once those questions are compiled and labs are done, I can speedrun all exam related content and ace the LFCS within the allotted 2 hours. 

## Next Steps

More speedruns until I can completely finish all questions within 2 hours.

## Social Proof
