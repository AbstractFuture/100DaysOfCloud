# KodeKloud Docker Course

## Introduction

Today I started (and intend to finish) the kodekloud introduction to docker for the absolute beginner. The course is free so if that interests you then check it out. All hands on labs are delivered through the browser and so no VM is required.

## Cloud Research

So far I've built images from Dockerfiles and now I'm moving onto creating yaml files for docker-compose. 

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I'm learning more about yaml which is needed to pass the CKA.

## Next Steps

Finish the docker course, begin the kubernetes course, and take my CKA exam prep.

## Social Proof
