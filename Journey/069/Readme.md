# Booking Exam (Again)

## Introduction

Today I booked My LFCS for Nov 1st, wish me luck!

Until then I'll be focusing on the three main sections of the exam; Essential commands (20%), Service Configuration (20%), and Operation of a running system (20%). 

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM.

## Misc Notes

- In my first attempt I focused too much on areas that were a smaller percentage of the exam (like LVM and other storage management nuances that I thought was cool but in terms of exam taking was a poor choice to focus on)
- Since my first attempt I now use vim as my default text editor to quickly edit files much faster than nano
- I reviewed syntax and labs for essential commands (tar balling different directories in different formats and recalling how to use find with regular expressions)
