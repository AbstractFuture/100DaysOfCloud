# LFCS Exam Day

## Introduction

Today I'll be retaking the LFCS in the evening while I do lab review the entire day. Wish me luck!

I've noticed that I struggle with repition because I like learning new things, as opposed to memorizing syntax for concepts I already understand. Like most things, this has some good aspects and some bad ones.

The good: I can consume lots of information, understand nuance and the big picture of whatever subject I'm investigating.

The bad: I get bored with repeating the same commands over and over. Hence why I left marketing. I thought tech might give me new information and new challenges. It also makes studying a bit of a challenge.

## Prerequisite

2 CentOS 7 VMs (and a good attitutde for your exam).

## Use Case

By the end of the year I intend to have the following certs to aid in my job search: LFCS, CKA, and AWS CCP. I am considering a python cert as well but I'm not sure if that is a good use of my time.

My aim is to land a cloud engineer role and then learn devops in 2021.

## Cloud Research

While not exactly 'cloud research' I did learn what sort of studying best serves me when it comes to practical hands on exams. 

Firstly, I always start from scratch. I delete the VM I used the day before and start completely fresh. This way I see where my knowledge gaps are right away. I don't have the benefit of having packages installed or my configuration set up in the way I like. I have to make the most of my knowledge and quickly scan for syntax or flags in man pages with grep. 

Secondly, once I complete a module I review all previous labs, building up memory of what commands certain procedures require. Repitition is key.

Lastly, since there is so much content to cover (for example, the study materials for the LFCS cover 21 hours of video content, whereas the CKA content is only 7 hours of video study content), I always type out full path names instead of changing into directories so that I can remember where everything is. I noticed that when I changed into directories, I would occasionally forget the path to the directory, and be unable to find my way back. 

## Try yourself

If you're practicing for a hands on practical exam then I encourage you to at least try these ideas out. I really think they will help you out.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Hopefully by end of day I'll be LFCS certified and move onto the CKA!

## Next Steps

Speedrun all labs today and pass the LFCS.
