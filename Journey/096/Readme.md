# CKA Exam Prep

## Introduction

Today I'm starting off with some CKA exam prep. I'll schedule my exam 7 days from now and we'll see how ready I am.

The upside of scheduling the CKA early (I mean who really considers 1 week sufficient for the CKA if this is their first exposure to it?) is that the CKA offers a candidate a retry if they fail. Therefore I can use this to my advantage by learning what sort of questions will be on the exam. Consider taking the exam before you're ready as gathering intelligence.

## Cloud Research

Since Kuburnetes has so many features, a candidate is allowed to have one browser window open to look at the kubernetes documentation. This will allow you to quickly copy yaml templates over (although it is your responsibility to ensure the template suits the task). 

CKA exam topics include;
- core concepts
- scheduling
- logging and monitoring
- application life cycle management
- cluster maintenance
- security
- storage
- networking

## Next Steps

- complete exam prep
- build devops project
- enter the job market
