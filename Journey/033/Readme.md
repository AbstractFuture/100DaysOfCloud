## Docker & RAID

I successfully set the docker container restart parameter such that when docker starts, the container (in this case memcached) would start automatically. I then stopped docker, verified it stopped, restarted docker and then checked the container status: it all worked!

I also set up a raid 5 device which I intend to go into greater detail tomorrow once I finish expirimenting. 

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM, but any distro should suffice.

## Next Steps

Creating a more detailed raid level 5 device tutorial and then perhaps more on user quotas and SSH.
