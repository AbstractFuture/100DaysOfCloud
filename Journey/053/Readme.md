# Job Post Research

## Introduction

Today, as part of a 4 person team in the AWS re/START program, I researched entry level sys admin roles available in Toronto.

## Prerequisite

While a certification is not a requirement I did notice that the job posts would vary in what was being asked. I did recognize that all skills requested were a part of the LFCS though, so if you want a role as a sys admin and don't know where to begin, check out the LFCS or RHCSA and learn more.

## Cloud Research

I found an even number of job postings specifying rhel/centos and ubuntu/debian.

## Social Proof
