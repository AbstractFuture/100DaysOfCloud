# Kubernetes - Imperative & Declarative Commands

## Introduction

Today I'll be finishing up the overview section, review all labs, and then continue onto the scheduling section of the exam content. There is about 80% of study content remaining.

The final lab of the overview section was about completing all kubernetes tasks in an imperative manner.

### Imperative vs Declarative

For the CKA exam, it is recommended to use imperative commands since they are fairly quick and require fewer (if any) yaml configuration files to generate pods and their configuration.

For production environments, it is recommended to use declarative commands so that each step in generating your specified configuration is automaticaly QA'd and tested by kubernetes, ensuring that no steps were skipped, and all config files are available for any member of the team to investigate and alter.
