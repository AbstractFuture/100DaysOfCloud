# Resetting VM

## Introduction

After some difficulty completing LFCS exam practice labs from the complexity of new changes I made, I decided to start from a new VM.

The old CentOS VM had many things altered from my practice labs and personal tinkering, which doesn't necessarily give me a complete picture of steps I need to take to reproduce or solve a problem. 

## Prerequisite

Some practical VM experience is useful here, specifically if you used it to prepare for remote exams.

## Cloud Research

Some of the issues I had that I am now solving with greater ease after using a new VM with basic settings:

- Configuring user permissions 

- Setting up/ removing encrypted disks

- After adding in so many new block devices to practice RAID and LVM, it was getting difficult to keep track of what I was building

- Realizing some packages are not installed on the distro by default

- Figuring out which process produced the resolv.conf file

## Next Steps

Continuing with LFCS exam review, of course!
