# LFCS Sample Exam

## Introduction

Like I suspected after failing my first LFCS exam (I get a free retake so that wasn't a problem :), always be optimistic), I am slow when it comes to basic tasks which eats up too much of my time. 

While working through the sample exam provided by the Linux Foundation (which can be found [here](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/LFCS-Practice-Questions-v1.0.pdf) ) I can tell I need more practice on the basics still.

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM.

## Cloud Research

The good news is I start from a brand new VM everyday now so that I have to recall all the steps and configurations taken instead of just setting something once and forgetting about it. 

## Next Steps

I intend to retake the LFCS in another 2 weeks or so. Until then I am practicing my fundamentals and doing all of it from a brand new VM and in a timed manner.
