# Productivity Tips (Don't shoot the messenger)

## Introduction

As a fair warning to all readers, not all tips discussed have anything to do with tech BUT I noticed that I am much more productive when studying tech or coding after applying these steps so please don't shoot the messenger.

## Tips

- Actually sleeping 8 hours improves focus (as opposed to 5 or less like I used to). I didn't realize how chronically sleep deprived I was until the covid lockdown came and I was able to work and study from home. No more spending 4 hours commuting. Some actionable items are;
    - no coffee after noon
    - exercising in the morning means you will be tired (or at least not wide awake) during the evening
    - a regular bed time will add consistency (I struggled with this for years)

- Exercise and lose weight. Yeah, I said it. Yeah, I meant it. Prior to the covid lockdown I was weighing in somewhere over 200 lbs. Since I have 4 more hours in my day since I'm not commuting, I use 2 hours for exercise now. Weight training, cardio, and daily walking. I have a kitchen scale at home and now track caloric intake and im down to 175 and have dropped about 4 inches from my waist. My sleep has been very good since this weight loss. Some actionable items;
    - Start tracking calories. If you don't have the time to exercise then the biggest way to lose that weight is cut your caloric intake. [Dr. Mike Israetel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYeZVfPxwKM&t) has a very friendly explanation for how to think about healthy eating. I recommend you also check out his youtube channel. 
    - Spend 30-60 minutes walking. I started doing this daily as an excuse to get out of my house so I didn't go stir crazy and overall I enjoy it. 

- Remember your real reason for studying in the first place. Are your reasons financial? Is it debt, a newborn child expenses, a higher standard of living? Good. Tape a sticky note to your computer and every mirror in your house so you don't have the luxury of ignoring your goal. Are your reasons passion based? You hated working in a suit and tie and have your creativity stifled? Good. Use that as fuel when you study so you don't give up half way and waste your time. Action item;
    - tape or sticky note your reason for doing this on every mirror and computer screen. Seriously.
