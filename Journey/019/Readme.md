# LFCS Exam Review pt2

## Introduction

Continued going over some routine tasks such as creating users, creating groups and then associating users to groups. 

## Prerequisite

Any linux distro should suffice.

## Use Case

Associating users with groups is great for assigning permissions. For example, associating a group titled 'sales' with all sales reps users and then changing the permissions of the sales/ directory such that only sales people can access them is a good idea. Why allow all users on the system to have the opportunity (by accident or by malicious intent) to alter files that lead to errors. 

It's best to grant permissions to only those that need it.
