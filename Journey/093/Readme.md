# KodeCloud Kubernetes For Beginners

## Introduction

I finsihed the docker intro course and labs and moved onto Kubernetes. My hope is to finish the labs and course this weekend, and move onto exam practice. I intend to book my exam 7 days after I finish the kubernetes course. 

## Prerequisite

Some knowledge of docker (which can be gained with KodeKloud's Docker for beginners course). A good attitude also helps :)

## Next Steps

- Finish the Kubernetes course
- Schedule CKA exam for 7 days after finishing the Kubernetes course
- Do exam prep 7 days all day in a row
- Build DevOps project and enter the job market

If I fail the CKA on my first round I will add an additional 2 weeks of study, and use [killer.sh](https://killer.sh/cka) resources to ensure I am ready. 

I'm going full speed ahead! No breaks or excuses. Only a real good attitude and a lot of grit.
