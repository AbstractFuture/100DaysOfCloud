# LFCS Exam Review pt12

## Introduction

Exam review for the LFCS. I covered encryption for partitions, using systemd to mount partitions instead of using /etc/fstab (since really under the hood /etc/fstab is being interpreted by systemd anyways)

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM

## Next Steps

Continue with containerization, more SELinux, more networking, managing ssh services, and more.

## Social Proof
