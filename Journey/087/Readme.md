# Career Planning & Certs

## Introduction

I wanted to give a brief overview of my cloud journey thus far and some ideas about where I'll be going in the remainder of 2020. 

## Cloud Certs

I should have my LFCS results within the next 48 hours or so. I was a lot more confident this time around and I could easily answer the heavy weighted questions - which is quite an improvement!

Next on the list would be the CKA and AWS CCP. I was considering taking a python cert but all exams seem to be multiple choice and not performance based. Therefore I think I would prefer to build a project and host it on github for employers to explore or discuss with me in interviews. 

A hands on project, unlike multiple choice question exams, result in a tangible software deliverable - something I imagine employers would be keen to see as opposed to a credential they may be unfamiliar with.

My project will be something CI/CD related (most likely! This is still to be determined). 

This leaves me with another concern; am I placing too much value in the CKA exam and am I incorrectly prioritizing this cert instead of the hands on project? Should I change the order in which I pursue certs such that I can begin cold calling and reaching out employers sooner? 

If you have any insight into this, please reach out to me! I'd be very curious to hear your ideas.

## Next Steps

Have a clear priority for what needs to be accomplished, and in what order, for the remainder of 2020.
