# AWS Re/Start

## Introduction

AWS re/Start is a program offered by AWS (who, at least in this case, partner with local government) to offer free cloud bootcamps. It was amazing to get this acceptance email and I have been preparing the documents which I Will submit tomorrow!

## Cloud Research

You can find the AWS program [here](https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/) where you can inquire for more details. 

## Try yourself

The program is a full time 12 weeks of study.

In my case this will be done entirely remotely due to covid, but should you apply and be accepted at a later date you may need to attend in person. I recommend you do your due diligence and learn what is required of you should you choose to apply and accept the offer.

## Next Steps

Continue with the LFCS exam review, begin the cloud bootcamp, get my AWS cloud practitioner cert, and study for the CKA.

My goal is to transition into devops about 1-2 months after completing my 12 week bootcamp. Wish me luck!
