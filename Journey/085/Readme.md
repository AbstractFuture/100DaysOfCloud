# The Last Stretch

## Introduction

Today I reviewed the mariadb section of the LFCS content. I also completed a speedrun of the following labs: configuring a chaching only dns server, setting up an encrypted partition, and setting up a raid level 1 and level 5 device.

Tomorrow is the LFCS exam so I'm cramming in as much study time as I can.

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM (or 2 depending on if you want to do nfs/samba and ssh labs).

## Next Steps

Next steps include speed running the following labs:

- mariadb
- email handling
- squid web proxy

## Social Proof
