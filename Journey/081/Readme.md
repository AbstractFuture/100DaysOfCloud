# Setting Up Server 2

## Introduction

Today I setup a secondary VM to practice labs involving remote machines.

## Prerequisite

2 CentOS 7 VMs.

## Use Case

I can now practice the following labs:

- SSH: From one terminal I can log into another remote machine. pretty self explanatory why I need 2 VMs for this.

- File Sharing (NFS / CIFS): While I can setup drives available for sharing on a single machine, I needed a second VM to persistently mount these available directories.

## Next Steps

- speedrun previous labs
- web proxies, mariadb, and handling email labs up next

## Social Proof
