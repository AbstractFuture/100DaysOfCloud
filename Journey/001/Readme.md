# Where I'm At & Where I'm Going

## Where I'm At

- Prior to starting 100DaysOfCloud I was working towards my LFCS and CKA cert from the Linux Foundation as well as creating data ingestion pipelines in AWS with some opensource tech like Kafka. You can find out more [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-aranibar-8891a2103/detail/recent-activity/posts/).

## Where I'm Going
- My goal with the 100DaysOfCloud is to gain more competency, begin freelancing, land a full time data engineer or cloud engineer role and make more content to help people enter the industry.
