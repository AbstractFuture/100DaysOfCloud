# The Hundredth Day! (and other CKA stuff)

## Introduction

100 days goes by quickly if you're productive! It feels surreal that its really been 100 days. I've set up a second repo titled [100DaysOfCloudPart2](https://github.com/AbstractFuture/100DaysOfCloudPart2) where I will be continuing this journey! I'll be getting CKA certified, AWS CCP certified, and building projects to then enter the Toronto job market, so you'll want to check it out.

With regards to the CKA, I'll be speed running previous labs (which I estimate should take about 2 hours). Speed running labs has become the go-to way for me to see how well I actually understood the material, and how easily I can recall syntax. 



## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

- I was held accountable (if you haven't started the challenge, please do so! You'd be surprised how much you could change your life in 100 days)
- My linux skills are SO much stronger now
- I now have a basic knowledge of kubernetes
- I'm one step closer to being CKA certified!
- I'm another step closer to being a DevOps engineer in Toronto!

## Next Steps

I've set up a second repo titled [100DaysOfCloudPart2](https://github.com/AbstractFuture/100DaysOfCloudPart2) where I will be continuing this journey! 

I'll be getting CKA certified, AWS CCP certified, and building projects to then enter the Toronto job market.
