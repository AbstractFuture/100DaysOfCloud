Today I redid the nfs/cifs file sharing now that my secondary server was set up. I also redid the VirtualHost lab from scratch (practice makes perfect!).

## Prerequisite

2 CentOS 7 VMs. 

## Next Steps

- speedrun previous labs
- web proxies, mariadb, email handling, RAID, luks encrypted devices and other labs

## Social Proof
