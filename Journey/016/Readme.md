# Firewalls In Linux

## Introduction

Today I learned a bit about the firewalls used in CentOS 7 and Ubuntu.

## Cloud Research

CentOS 7 uses firewalld whereas Ubuntu uses ufw.

## Other Notes

I had a bit of trouble starting and enabling the firewalld on CentOS 7. While I followed several tutorials, started the service and enabled it, whenever I checked the status it remained inactive.

I'll have to do some more digging on this subject. I definitely don't want to walk into the LFCS exam not knowing firewalls!

## Next Steps

Diagnose and fix the issue.
