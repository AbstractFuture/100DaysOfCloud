# Text Editors & Linux

## Cloud Research

All files on linux are plaintext and so getting comfortable with text editors in linux seems like a good idea if you intend to spend any serious amount of time working with linux.

I intend for this to be a brief overview of 2 text editors; Nano and Vi. 

## Nano VS Vi
From the nano man pages:
```
nano  is  a  small and friendly editor.  It copies the look and feel of
       Pico, but is free software, and implements several features  that  Pico
       lacks,  such as: opening multiple files, scrolling per line, undo/redo,
       syntax coloring, line numbering, and soft-wrapping overlong lines.
```
Let's focus on the 'friendly editor' bit first. Nano was the first text editor I used in linux and so I didn't have the context for why that was worth mentioning.

In contrast, the first time I used Vi (which as I understand, has the same functionality as Vim), I couldn't even exit the file! I had to close my connection to the instance and start over - talk about a rough start!

If you've never used nano, I like to think of it as being like many popular proprietary tools in how it can be used: think google docs or microsoft word. You can begin typing, and then save and close the file.

Vi on the other hand starts off very differently. There are 2 modes in Vi - Interactive and Command. Interactive mode lets you add in text after pressing one of the many hotkeys, while command mode lets you perform commands (the name command mode was an apt description!). While this may seem vague, I've included a link to Vim Adventures, a site aimed at making vi/vim intuitive for you (because it is certainly not intuitive in the same manner nano is!). 

If you've never used vi and you think I am exaggerating then by all means go ahead and edit a file (and make sure it isn't important!) and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at.

With that aside, feel free to learn more about nano and vi in the links below.
