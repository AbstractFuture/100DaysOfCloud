## Introduction

Today I completed my Kubernetes Fundamentals course from the Linux Foundation, began the DevOps & SRE Fundamentals course, and learned a little bit about Terraform.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I'm better understanding the roles I'm hoping to transition into and add value asap. Also; I'm now ready to begin my CKA exam prep.

## Next Steps

One step closer to taking the CKA! I hope to pass before December. After that I'll start looking for entry cloud roles and build up my DevOps projects.
