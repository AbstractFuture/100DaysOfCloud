# Final 10 (and next steps)

## Introduction

We're nearly at the end of the #100DaysOfCloud challenge! And I'm so grateful that I got started on this journey. Having a daily post really kept me accountable, and from what I can see on twitter, that is a shared sentiment in the cloud community. Looking forward to the next 10 days and completing round 1 of #100DaysOfCloud!

## Cloud Research

Today I reviewed what CI/CD pipelines look like, what technology is involved, and started looking for some small devops projects to build. I also completed all my Linux Foundation courses! If you're curious what I studied, have a look at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-aranibar/) and scroll down to see my certifications. 

I intend to complete the docker and kubernetes kodekloud courses before doing my CKA. It would be really funny if I learned the content within 10 days whereas the LFCS took me ... longer than I would like to admit, haha. 

## Next Steps

- Stay consistent and finish the remaining 10 days of this challenge, which then completes round 1 of the #100DaysOfCloud challenge
- Begin round 2 and start another #100DaysOfCloud!
- Pass the CKA in a single attempt
- Begin reaching out to companies
- Build a devops project
