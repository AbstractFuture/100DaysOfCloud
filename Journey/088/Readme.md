# Talking With Mentors

## Introduction

I had the pleasure of speaking with Andrew Brown, who is one of the core team members of the #100DaysOfCloud, and asked about what my next steps should be in my cloud career.

## Cloud Progress Thus Far 

For context, I'm awaiting my LFCS exam results (fingers crossed!), and while I have a vague idea about what needs to get done before the end of 2020, I was a bit unsure which tasks to prioritize.

I know that I want to finish getting my CKA, my AWS CCP, and build a devops project, but I didn't know which of these things would prove most useful in the job search for the Toronto Market.

Andrew helped provide some insight: I originally intended to build a ci/cd pipeline project but Andrew explained that being "able to show your skills in a project can generally outweigh a certification if the project is complex enough and simulates a production workload. Ci/Cd pipelines are tricky because everybody does their own thing [...] CKA would be a better value add, since Kubernetes knowledge is more predictable [in terms of getting hired]. Most companies have a senior member that exclusively handles their deployment pipeline". 

Now this is why I always urge people to learn about their own markets from experienced people. You would be surprised how generous people are with their time, but you need to take the initiative and reach out! 

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

If you're in the Toronto market, prioritize getting your CKA instead of building a ci/cd project. It is more likely to increase your chances of getting hired. 

## Next Steps

Andrew also provided some alternatives to a ci/cd project that I could investigate. I hope to have a complete certificate and project timeline mapped out by the end of the week.
