# Cloud Career Updates

## Introduction

I thought perhaps a few of you might be interested in career cloud progress thus far as opposed to a brief tech tutorial or overview of commands.

If not then I will continue with strictly tech tutorials/ project content. 

## Cloud Progress

Over the last 3 weeks I've;

- speed tested myself completing LFCS labs

- had a recruiter review my resume and give me actionable tips to improve readability

- connected with several Toronto based professionals in the cloud/ devops field

- attended several cloud and devops meetups which have strengthened my resolve to complete my 3 certifications (LFCS, CKA, AWS CCP) within 90 days

- consulted with the devops reddit page about what python resources and projects to investigate

## Next Steps

- continue LFCS speedrun practice labs

- find recruiting agencies in Toronto specialized in placing devops/ cloud talent

- complete the 3 aforementioned certs within 90 days (sooner would be better)

- implement all changes to my resume

- begin building out job posting crm and begin cold calling companies, recruiters, and hiring managers in general
