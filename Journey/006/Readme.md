# SSH - Secure Shell
## Introduction

I took some time today to learn more about ssh, which stands for 'secure shell'. Like the name implies, it is meant to be secure by hashing the password you use to login to your remote machine and therefore prevents a successful man-in-the-middle hack. 

A man-in-the-middle attack is when a hacker recieves your commands and input before they reach their destination (which would be the remote machine you are trying to access). If your commands or passwords are sent to the remote machine as unencrypted plain text then anyone intercepting it now knows your credentials. That is highly insecure. 

Therefore please use ssh as opposed to unencrypted shell protocols like telnet. 

## Use Case

Using ssh is a best practice for sysadmins, or anyone using linux.
