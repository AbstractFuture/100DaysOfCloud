# LFCS Exam Review pt3

## Introduction

I mainly practiced with permissions today. Exercises included assigning group permissions to users and altered shared directory permissions such that certain users can access directories with read and write permissions.

## Next Steps

I intend to alter permissions such that one of the many practice users I've created will be able to delete files in shared directories that belong to a group that this test user is not a part of.

## Social Proof
