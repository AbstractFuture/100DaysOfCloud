# LFCS Exam Review pt14

## Introduction

Revisited cron and docker.

## Prerequisite

A CentOS7 VM

## Cron

- learned about step time (scheduling something every few minutes as opposed to one specific minute within the hour) -> ```*/10``` would mean every ten minutes
- range of time using ```-``` to specify action to be performed within a certain range -> ```11-12``` in the hour column, for example.

## Docker

Still working on making a container start automatically when docker restarts or starts on reboot.
