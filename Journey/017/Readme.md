# SELinux

## Introduction

SELinux stands for Security Enhanced Linux. It is the default securty architecture on CentOS / RedHat. SELinux was developed by the NSA and was created to allow sys admins better control over what resources users have access to. 

## Use Case

Instead of imagining all theoretical ways all processes on your system can be used by a user (or hacker!) for malicious purposes, it is easier to configure a SELinux policy which will prevent or allow users from accessing files. 

## Cloud Research

I previously wrote a bit about SELinux in my [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/docker-aws-amazon-linux-2-instance-steven-aranibar/) on linkedin about installing docker on the amazon linux2 ec2 instance, where I troubleshooted and learned about accessing and changing SELinux settings.

If you're interested in any of those subjects, I definitely recommend checking out that [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/docker-aws-amazon-linux-2-instance-steven-aranibar/). I take detailed screenshots and explain what online resources I'm learning from as I learn about SELinux.

## Try yourself
