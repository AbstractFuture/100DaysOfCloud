# Speedrun Review + SELinux (also firewalling)

## Introduction

Today I completed all previous labs on a fresh VM for practice. Then I moved onto studying SELinux and firewall-cmd. I still have yet to complete the SELinux labs.

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM.

## Next Steps

Next labs will be storage management (lvm and raid ) and then managing user quotas followed by a speedrun of all labs thus far.

## Social Proof
