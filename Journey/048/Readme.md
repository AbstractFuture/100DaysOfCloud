# Basic Lab Review

## Introduction

Reviewed old completed labs and tried to do them within a time limit.

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM

## Cloud Research

I learned that while I had memorized more complicated content (within the context of the LFCS) like RAID and LVM, my fundamentals aren't strong enough to where I can perform them quickly. I can see this will be a hindrance to me on the LFCS exam.

## Next Steps

Practice the fundamentals using tar and its options, chmod, chroot, chgrp.

More advanced topics that I still strugle with include: SELinux  options and iptables. 

## Social Proof
