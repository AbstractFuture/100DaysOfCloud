# Various LFCS Labs

## Introduction

Today I reviewed labs regarding networking, virtual hosts, scheduling tasks, lvm, and altering sudo configuration for new users.

## Prerequisite

A CentOS 7 VM.

## Next Steps

I'll continue speed running labs and commiting steps to memory such that I can finish the LFCS within the time limit.

An interesting side note is that LFCS broad range of topics is about 3 times the size as the CKA (at least in terms of video study content). I'll consider this good news because I aim to complete the CKA shortly thereafter.
